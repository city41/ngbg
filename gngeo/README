# gngeo.js

This fork of gngeo is an attempt to get gngeo working in a browser using WebAssembly. The ultimate goal is to build a web based tool related to Neo Geo games, so the emulator will be stripped to just the bare essentials.

## How to build and run

check out EMSCRIPTEN.md in this repo

## original README

The original README for gngeo has been preserved in this repo at README.original

## How it differs

* sound has been completely removed
* all cores not written in C have been removed (only gen68k remains)
* all capabilities to build for alternate platforms (wii, gp2x, etc) have been removed
* will pull in emscripten specific concepts into the code as needed
* will standup an emscripten based build system
* all code related to loading files from the file system will be removed in favor of finding the rom data at a shared memory location between wasm and normal JS
