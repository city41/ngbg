# NGBG

A Neo Geo background extraction tool.

The plan is to take GnGeo, port it to the web using WebAssembly, hook into the Neo Geo's memory, and then build tools around that which enable extracting out animated backgrounds relatively easily.

## Status

Brand spanking new. Got GnGeo running under wasm/emscripten enough to start thinking about the whole project now
