# NGBG

A Neo Geo background extraction tool. Once finished, it will enable making animated gifs of Neo Geo backgrounds very easy.

## Status

The tool now successfully extracts simple backgrounds. There is still much work to be done:
  
* tools to nudge sprites, they are often wrapped incorrectly in raw memory
* ability to support parallaxing backgrounds
* support manual sprite animation
* other tools to just make life easier (like drag a window to crop the size of the gif)

## How to use

For now, easiest to just watch this video and just play around with things

NOTE: gngeo is the emulator that is running, and it wants your ROM files to be in a very specific format. For me, my samsho2, mslug, kof94 and kof95 roms all work fine. But my aof, aof3, pulstar, etc ROMs do not load. I'll eventually fix this.

game controls:

* arrow keys
* p1 start: 1
* p1 coin: 3
* p1 a: z
* p1 b: x
* p1 c: a
* p1 d: s

TODO: solidify p2 controls
